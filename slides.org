* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to my customized instance of GNU Emacs.

* What is GNU Emacs?

Its [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][website]] says:

(insert a good excuse for this blank space)

** Let's run it!

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens... What is GNU?

** GNU/Linux?

[[file:images/linus-torvalds-vs-richard-stallman.jpeg]]

*** Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- Launched the GNU Project (GNU's not Unix) in 1983 with the goal of:

  - creating a complete Unix-compatible software system composed entirely of
    free software.

- developed GNU Emacs in 1985;

- founded the Free Software Foundation.

**** Free Software

Free software - free as in freedom, not as in free beer.

It gives software users the freedom to use, study, distribute and modify it.

*** Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (Linux) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created git in 2005.

Open source - a software development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

*** Conclusion

- It's either GNU+Linux or GNU/Linux, not just +Linux+.

- GNU Emacs is part of this amazing operating system.

- You can do pretty much everything without leaving it.

* Why a text editor?

One programm to rule them all.

Free our brain from trivial text manipulation.

** Example

Given the following text, let's do smth stuff:

aadcg@vestas.com
amaol@vestas.com
asoad@vestas.com
calvr@vestas.com
darfe@vestas.com
erofi@vestas.com
gofmi@vestas.com
miabd@vestas.com
rebrf@vestas.com
rijmc@vestas.com
timdc@vestas.com

* Mindstorm
=TRAMP is for transparently accessing remote files from within Emacs.=

TRAMP stands for Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple Protocol.

** Going wherever without ever leaving

*** Example 1

#+begin_src sh
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm!'
  uptime
  nproc
  who
#+end_src

*** Example 2

#+begin_src sh
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm! Got some processors?'
  who
  nproc
#+end_src

** Dired mode and visiting files

- [[file:/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/][my home folder]]

- [[file:/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/dm/cfd/app/PSE2/benchmark.v2/0410f736-9499-43aa-b974-baa1f0151621/ac_inputs.json][json file]]

- [[file:/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/pse2_venv_prod.yml][yml file]]

** Terminal emulator

There are quite some alternatives to get shell functionality inside Emacs.

Here's a subset of those alternatives:

- [ ] ansi-term (or term)
- [X] shell-command and async-shell-command


- [ ] I need to do this
- [ ] and also that
- [X] and that

* Python

** Basic example

Programmers only write two programs:
- Hello World
- Factorial

#+begin_src python
  print('Hello World')
#+end_src

** Plottting
#+begin_src python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
  path = './demo.png'
  plt.savefig(path)
  return path
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
  module load anaconda/2-5.1.0
  python example.py
#+end_src
Hello

** EIN (Emacs IPython Notebook)

(async-shell-command "jupyter notebook --no-browser")

* Magit

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

It can actually be faster than using the command line!

* Miscellaneous

Let's have fun

* Games

(snake)

* Doctor

(doctor)

* Holidays and calendar

* PDF

[[pdfview:~/NextCloud/[Eric_S._Raymond]_The_Cathedral_&_the_Bazaar__Musi(z-lib.org).pdf::15][The Cathedral and the Bazaar - Eric Raymond]]

* Cross platform

=Emacs runs on several operating systems regardless of the machine type. The
main ones are: GNU, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, MS Windows and
Solaris.=

=We include support for some proprietary systems in GNU Emacs in the hope that
running Emacs on them will give users a taste of freedom and thus lead them to
free themselves.=

Quoted from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux][here]].

** Android

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

Quite useful since Emacs is my agenda.

(switch-to-buffer "*Org Agenda*")

* Conclusion

GNU Emacs allows you to define the way you do your computing.

The users control the software.

Its devoted community is its backbone.

* Getting help

Please feel free to approach me anytime.
I will tailor my help to your needs.

Keep in mind that GNU Emacs is also the self documenting text editor!

(info)

** Vi(m) users

=Recall that vi vi vi is the editor of the beast.=
(joke by Richard Stallman.)

If you're too used to vi(m) keybindings:
- use EVIL mode
- use Spacemacs

* What I've shown

- Google translator
- Web browser (eww)
- Terminal emulator (ansi-term)
- Remote files editor (TRAMP)
- Python IDE (elpy)
- PDF reader (pdf-tools)
- Image viewer
- A bunch of perks (claendar, games, doctor, agenda, etc)

What I didn't show:

- Emacs as a window manager


This is just a grain of sand!

** But...

Actually I've shown you a demo of org mode and literate programming.

=Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead
of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.=

- Donald Knuth
