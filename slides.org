* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to (my customized) *GNU Emacs*.

Enjoy!

* What is it?

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][Website]] says:

(I have a good excuse for the blank space.)

* Let's run it!

(async-shell-command "emacs -q")

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens. What is *GNU*?

[[file:images/gnu.png]]

* GNU/Linux?

I wish everyone could guess what I'm going to say next.

Sadly, that might not be true.

* Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- launched the *GNU Project* (GNU's not Unix) in 1983;

- developed *GNU Emacs* in 1985;

- founded the *Free Software Foundation*.

* Free Software

Free as in *freedom*, not as in free beer.

It gives software users the freedom to:

1. use
2. study
3. distribute
4. modify

This doesn't mean that it is anti-commercial!

* Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (*Linux*) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created *git* in 2005.

* Open Source

A decentralized development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

* Conclusion

- It's either *GNU/Linux* or *GNU+Linux*, not +Linux+;

- *GNU Emacs* is part of GNU;

- You can do everything without leaving it.

(woman "ls")

* Why a text editor?

- One program to rule them all;

- Free our brain from trivial text handling.

Ex:

(macros w counter)
(rectangles)
(sort)
(upper case)
(comma macro)

Person1 name1@somewhere.com
Person2 name2@somewhere.com
Person3 name1@somewhere.com
Person4 name2@somewhere.com
Person5 name1@somewhere.com

name1@here.com
name2@here.com
name1@here.com
name2@here.com
name1@here.com

* Dired mode and visiting files

- [[file:/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/dm/cfd/app/PSE2/benchmark.v2/0410f736-9499-43aa-b974-baa1f0151621/ac_inputs.json][json file]]

- [[file:/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/pse2_venv_prod.yml][yml file]]

- [[file:/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/][my home folder]]

* Bash commands

There are multiple ways. Here's two:

- [ ] (shell-command "some-command")
  (async-shell-command "some-command")

  equivalent to:

  $ some-command
  $ some-command &

- [ ] (ansi-term "/bin/bash")

  terminal emulator (like GNOME Terminal, tmux, etc)

* Basic example
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:python: :results output :tangle /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/demo/hello.py
:END:

Programmers only write two programs:
- Hello World;
- Factorials.

#+begin_src python
  print('Hello World')
#+end_src

* Plottting
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:python: :results file
:END:

#+begin_src python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
  path = './demo.png'
  plt.savefig(path)
  return path
#+end_src

* Magit

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

It can actually be faster than using the command line!

* Miscellaneous

Let's have fun!

* Android

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

Quite useful since Emacs is my agenda.

(switch-to-buffer "*Org Agenda*")

Screen-stream demo!

* Why Emacs?

YOU define the way you do your computing.

Its devoted community is what makes it special.

* Getting help

Feel free to approach me anytime.

I will tailor my help to your needs.

Anyway, this is the self documenting text editor!

* Did your brain just explode?

Then I did my job well!

No, I'm not magician! It's way simpler than you think.

It's *Org Mode* and its *literate programming* capabilities.


Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead
of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
- Donald Knuth
