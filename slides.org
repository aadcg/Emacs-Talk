Today's technological world is both exciting and alarming.

Exciting because we have the tools to solve the challenging problems of our
overpopulated planet. The vision of a connected, peaceful and fair world feels
closer than ever.

Alarming because tech companies offer tons of malware that people greet without
questioning - exchanging their freedom for a fake sense of pleasure and a fake
sense of productivity.

In this talk, I will show that GNU Emacs is the perfect environment for a
focused and free life in a world full of corrupted people and bullshit.

* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to the world of *GNU Emacs*.

Enjoy!

(view-hello-file)

* What is GNU Emacs?

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][Website]] says:

(I have a good excuse for the blank space.)

* Let's run it!

(async-shell-command "emacs -q")

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens. What is *GNU*?

* GNU/Linux?

I wish everyone could guess what I'm going to say next.

Sadly, that might not be the case.

* Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- launched the *GNU Project* (GNU's not Unix) in 1983;

- developed *GNU Emacs* in 1985;

- founded the *Free Software Foundation*.

* Free Software

Free as in *freedom*, not as in free beer.

It gives software users the freedom to:

1. use
2. study
3. distribute
4. modify

This doesn't mean that it is anti-commercial!

* Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (*Linux*) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created *git* in 2005.

* Open Source

A decentralized development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

* Conclusion

- It's either *GNU/Linux* or *GNU+Linux*, not +Linux+;

- *GNU Emacs* is part of GNU;

- You can do everything without leaving it.

* Why a text editor?

- One program to rule them all;

- Free our brain from trivial text handling.

* Version Control (git)

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

Way better than using the command line.

* Miscellaneous

жизнь

* Speaking of life...

...GNU Emacs manages my life! It's my agenda!

(switch-to-agenda)

* Cross Platform

I usually have 3 devices:

- personal laptop
- work laptop (Windows + VirtualBox + GNU/Linux)
- android phone

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

* Android demo

(browse-url-firefox "http://192.168.1.65:8080/")

* So... Why Emacs?

*YOU* define the way you do your computing.

Its community is both knowledgeable and ethical.
