* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to my customized GNU Emacs.

This is a live demo.

Enjoy!

- Hi! Thanks.

- Setup - VM, Ubuntu

- Difficult talk given that we're miles away from sharing a common background
  (even amongst emacs user).

- Please relate to this talk as if you're at the cinema. Please passively acept
the fact that you don't understand wtf is going on here.

- Some of the things I will show will be more useful that others. I tried to
take everyone into account.

- You will have tons of questions, let's deal with them in the end.

- Focus on the WHAT, not on the HOW.

* What is GNU Emacs?

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][Website]] says:

(I have a good excuse for the blank space.)

#+begin_comment
- A browser is indispensable nowadays. We write code by copying&pasting it from
stack overflow.

- I can access it without leaving my text editor.

- Open link

- paste a sentence

- Let's assume you have downloaded it and let's run it!
#+end_comment

** Let's open it!

(async-shell-command "emacs -q")

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens. What is GNU?

[[file:images/gnu.png]]

** GNU/Linux?

I wish everyone could guess what I'm going to say next.

Sadly, that's not true.

Who are they?

#+begin_comment
- the above picture sums up everything I will be telling for the next 5 minutes

- who are these people? anyone?

- we need a short historical context
#+end_comment

*** Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- launched the GNU Project (GNU's not Unix) in 1983 with the goal of:

  - creating a complete Unix-compatible software system composed entirely of
    free software.

- developed GNU Emacs in 1985;

- founded the Free Software Foundation.

*** Free Software

*Free as in freedom, not as in free beer.*

It gives software users the freedom to use, study, distribute and modify it.

*** Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (Linux) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created git in 2005.

*** Open Source

A decentralized development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

*** Conclusion

- It's either GNU+Linux or GNU/Linux, not just +Linux+.

- GNU Emacs is part of this amazing operating system.

- You can do everything without leaving it.

* Why a text editor?
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:python: :results output replace
:END:

Before conquering the world, we should be good at trivial things.

Perhaps the most basic abilities are reading and writing.

Learn how to use a text editor because:

  - One programm to rule them all;

  - Free our brain from trivial text manipulation.

* Mindstorm
:PROPERTIES:
:exports: both
:END:

=TRAMP is for transparently accessing remote files from within Emacs.=

** Going everywhere without ever leaving

I use my local Emacs to edit remote files.

*** Example 1
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:sh: :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/
:END:

#+begin_src sh
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm!'
  uptime
  nproc
  who
#+end_src

#+begin_comment
- :results raw
- C-c C-c
- C-x r M-w followed by C-x r y
- drop duplicates
- sort
- upper case
- add e-mail
- comma macro
#+end_comment

*** Example 2
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:sh: :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net|ssh:aadco@ac002:~/
:END:

#+begin_src sh
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm! Got processors?'
  who
  nproc
#+end_src

** Dired mode and visiting files

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/dm/cfd/app/PSE2/benchmark.v2/0410f736-9499-43aa-b974-baa1f0151621/ac_inputs.json][json file]]

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/pse2_venv_prod.yml][yml file]]

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/][my home folder]]

** Bash commands

There are multiple ways. Here's two:

- [ ] (ansi-term "/bin/bash")

  terminal emulator (like GNOME Terminal, tmux, etc)

- [X] (shell-command) and (async-shell-command)

  equivalent to $ some-command
                $ some-command &

#+begin_comment
C-u M-!
#+end_comment

* Python
:PROPERTIES:
:exports:  both
:END:

** Basic example
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:python: :results output :tangle /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/example.py
:END:

Programmers only write two programs:
- Hello World
- Factorial

#+begin_src python
  print('Hello World')
#+end_src

** Plottting
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:python: :results file
:END:

#+begin_src python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
  path = './demo.png'
  plt.savefig(path)
  # return path
#+end_src

*** Mindstorm
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:sh: :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/
:END:

#+begin_src sh
  pwd
  module load anaconda/2-5.1.0
  python example.py
#+end_src

** EIN (Emacs IPython Notebook)

(async-shell-command "jupyter notebook --no-browser")

* Magit

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

It can actually be faster than using the command line!

#+begin_comment
ACTION: commit current changes! and then revert.
#+end_comment

* Miscellaneous

Let's have fun!

#+begin_comment
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you are
finished talking, type RET twice.

Well, people don't get Emacs... They say it's complicated

Emacs?  Hah!  I would appreciate it if you would continue.

I simply love Emacs...

Are you sure?

Oh yes!
#+end_comment

** Android

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

Quite useful since Emacs is my agenda.

(switch-to-buffer "*Org Agenda*")

* COMMENT Cross platform

=Emacs runs on several operating systems regardless of the machine type. The
main ones are: GNU, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, MS Windows and
Solaris.=

=We include support for some proprietary systems in GNU Emacs in the hope that
running Emacs on them will give users a taste of freedom and thus lead them to
free themselves.=
(Quoted from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux][here]].)

* Why Emacs?

YOU define the way you do your computing.

Its devoted community is what makes it special.

* Getting help

Feel free to approach me anytime.
I will tailor my help to your needs.

Anyway, this is the self documenting text editor!

(info)

#+begin_comment
- there are lots of recourses out there. I happen to know them quite well.

- I'd be happy to advice any of you by understading your needs and tailor the
solution given those needs.
#+end_comment

** Vi(m) users

=Recall that vi vi vi is the editor of the beast.=
(joke by Richard Stallman.)

If you're used to vi(m) keybindings:
- try EVIL mode;
- use Spacemacs.

* Did your brain just explod?

Then I did my job well!

I think you're very confused...

No, I'm not magician! It's way simpler than you think.

It's *Org Mode* and its literate programming capabilities.

=Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead
of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.=

- Donald Knuth

** Sidenote

I wrote code to make this presentation.

I could even give a talk talking about how I prepared of this talk.

And it would still be interesting.
