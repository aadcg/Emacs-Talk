* Hello!

So, Emacs...
[[file:logo.png]]


Welcome to my Emacs.

Please find my config files at [[https://github.com/aadcg/.emacs.d][https://github.com/aadcg/.emacs.d]].

Please find these slides at [[https://github.com/aadcg/Emacs-Talk][https://github.com/aadcg/Emacs-Talk]].

Some of the images were taken from [[https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society/][this talk]] given by Richard Stallman.

- hi
- my first talk
- difficult talk given that we don't share a common background (even amongst
  emacs user)
- this is not a tutorial, please do not focus on the how, but on the WHAT!

* What is GNU Emacs?

** Let's open it

A [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][text editor]] that greets you with:

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

** What is GNU/Linux?

[[file:linus-torvalds-vs-richard-stallman.jpg]]

*** Richard Stallman

[[file:stallman.jpeg]]

- launched the GNU Project (GNU's not Unix) in 1983;
- developed GNU Emacs in 1985.

Free software - free as in freedom, not as in free beer.

It gives software users the freedom to use, study, distribute and modify it.

*** Linus Torvalds

[[file:linus.jpeg]]

- developed the kernel (Linux) for the GNU operating system in 1994;
- created git in 2005 (our beloved version control software).

Open source - a software development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

*** Conclusions

[[file:free_vs_open.png]]

[[file:gnu+linux.png]]

It's GNU + Linux or GNU/Linux, not just Linux.

Emacs is part of this amazing operating system.
And you can do pretty much everything without leaving it.


GNU coreutils and M-x woman.

* Why a text editor?

One programm to rule them all.

** Example
Given the following text, let's do smth stuff:

aadcg@vestas.com
amaol@vestas.com
asoad@vestas.com
calvr@vestas.com
darfe@vestas.com
erofi@vestas.com
gofmi@vestas.com
miabd@vestas.com
rebrf@vestas.com
rijmc@vestas.com
timdc@vestas.com

** Terminal emulator

There are quite some alternatives to get shell functionality inside Emacs.

Here's a subset of those alternatives:

- [ ] ansi-term (or term)
- [X] shell-command and async-shell-command


- [ ] I need to do this
- [ ] and also that
- [X] and that

* Python
** Basic example

Programmers only write two programs:
- Hello World
- Factorial

#+begin_src python :results output
  print('Hello World')
#+end_src

** Plottting

#+begin_src python :results file
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
  path = './demo.png'
  plt.savefig(path)
  return path
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./demo.png]]

* Magit
=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

It can actually be faster than using the command line!

#+begin_comment

** Psychotherapist

~M-x doctor~

Well, people don't get Emacs...

#+begin_comment
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you are
finished talking, type RET twice.

Well, people don't get Emacs... They say it's complicated

Emacs?  Hah!  I would appreciate it if you would continue.

I simply love Emacs...

Are you sure?

Oh yes!

** Conclusion

Emacs allows you to define the way you do your computing.

The user controls the software.

* Getting help

I am here.

Emacs is also the self documenting text editor!

It all comes down to C-h something

#+begin_comment
There's more than enough recourses out there. I happen to know them quite
well. I'd be happy to advice any of you by understading your needs and tailor
the solution given those needs.

If you're too used to vi(m) keybindings:
- use EVIL mode
- use Spacemacs
