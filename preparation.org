Today's technological world is both exciting and alarming.

Exciting because we have the tools to solve the challenging problems of our
overpopulated planet. The vision of a connected, peaceful and fair world feels
closer than ever.

Alarming because tech companies offer tons of malware that people greet without
questioning - exchanging their freedom for a fake sense of pleasure and a fake
sense of productivity.

In this talk, I will show that GNU Emacs is the perfect environment for a
focused and free life in a world full of corrupted people and bullshit.

* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to the world of *GNU Emacs*.

Enjoy!

** COMMENT
- Hi! Thanks.
- Experience with Emacs, org-mode?
- This isn't a tutorial. Focus on the WHAT, not on the HOW.

* What is GNU Emacs?

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][Website]] says:

(I have a good excuse for the blank space.)

** COMMENT
- Eww: no javascript but displays images
- Browser in my text editor means that I can quickly copy and paste from
  websites (e.g. from stack overflow)
- I can access it without leaving my text editor.

DEMO:
- open link
- paste sentence

- Let's assume you have downloaded it and let's run it!

* Let's run it!

(async-shell-command "emacs -q")

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens. What is *GNU*?

[[file:images/gnu.png]]

** COMMENT
- read the tutorial

DEMO:
run sexp

* GNU/Linux?

I wish everyone could guess what I'm going to say next.

Sadly, that might not be the case.

** COMMENT
- the above picture sums up everything I will be telling
- who are these people?

* Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- launched the *GNU Project* (GNU's not Unix) in 1983;

- developed *GNU Emacs* in 1985;

- founded the *Free Software Foundation*.

** COMMENT

* Free Software

Free as in *freedom*, not as in free beer.

It gives software users the freedom to:

  1) use
  2) study
  3) distribute
  4) modify

This doesn't mean that it is anti-commercial!

** COMMENT

* Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (*Linux*) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created *git* in 2005.

* Open Source

A decentralized development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

- It's either *GNU/Linux* or *GNU+Linux*, not +Linux+;

- *GNU Emacs* is part of GNU;

- You can do everything without leaving it.

** COMMENT
- woman stands for without manual

* Why a text editor?

- One program to rule them all;

- Free our brain from trivial text handling.

* Writing programs
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:python: :results output
:END:

Programmers only write two programs:
  - Hello World
  - Factorial

#+begin_src python
  print('Hello Porto Codes!')
#+end_src

#+begin_src go
  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main() {
          fmt.Println("Hello Porto Codes")
  }
#+end_src

** COMMENT

* ...a text file that is able to run code in most programming languages?

It's *Org Mode* and its *literate programming* capabilities.

Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead
of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
- Donald Knuth

#+begin_src python

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')

  plt.savefig(path)

** COMMENT

* Version Control

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

Way better than using the command line.

** COMMENT

ACTION: commit current changes! and then revert.

* Speaking of life...

...GNU Emacs manages my life!

(switch-to-agenda)

** COMMENT

* Cross Platform

I usually have 3 devices:

- personal laptop
- work laptop (Windows + VirtualBox + GNU/Linux)
- android phone

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

Quite useful since Emacs is my agenda.

Screen-stream demo!

** COMMENT

* Android demo

** COMMENT

* So... Why Emacs?

*YOU* define the way you do your computing.

Its community is both knowledgeable and ethical.
