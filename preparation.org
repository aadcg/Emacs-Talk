* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to my customized GNU Emacs.

This is a live demo.

Enjoy!

#+begin_comment
- hi!
- my setup (VM, Ubuntu).
- difficult talk given that we don't share a common background (even amongst
  emacs user).
- i will try to show smth useful for everyone. but that means that some of you
will feel quite lost during some moments. bear with me.
- you will have tons of questions, but please try to abstract from the
technicalities of what you'll be seeing.
- this is not a tutorial, please do not focus on the how, but on the WHAT!
- translate word enjoy.

* What is GNU Emacs?

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][Website]] says:

(I have a good excuse for the blank space.)

#+begin_comment
- open website with eww
- paste An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more.
- Let's assume you have downloaded it and let's run it!
#+end_comment

** Let's run it!

(async-shell-command "emacs -q")

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens. What is GNU?

[[file:images/gnu.png]]

** GNU/Linux?

Can anyone guess what I'm going to say next?

Who are they?

#+begin_comment
- the above picture sums up everything I will be telling for the next 5 minutes
- who are these people? anyone?
- we need a short historical context
#+end_comment

*** Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- Launched the GNU Project (GNU's not Unix) in 1983 with the goal of:

  - creating a complete Unix-compatible software system composed entirely of
    free software.

- developed GNU Emacs in 1985;

- founded the Free Software Foundation.

**** Free Software

*Free as in freedom, not as in free beer.*

It gives software users the freedom to use, study, distribute and modify it.

*** Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (Linux) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created git in 2005.

**** Open Source

A decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

*** Conclusion

- It's either GNU+Linux or GNU/Linux, not just +Linux+.

- GNU Emacs is part of this amazing operating system.

- You can do pretty much everything without leaving it.

* Why a text editor?

- One programm to rule them all.

:PROPERTIES:
:results: replace
:exports: code
:END:

=TRAMP is for transparently accessing remote files from within Emacs.=

** Going everywhere without ever leaving

*** Example 1

#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/ :results raw
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm!'
  uptime
  nproc
  who
#+end_src

#+begin_comment
- :results raw
- C-c C-c
- C-x r M-w followed by C-x r y
- drop duplicates
- sort
- upper case
- add e-mail
- comma macro
#+end_comment

*** Example 2

#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net|ssh:aadco@ac003:~/
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm! Got some processors?'
  who
  nproc
#+end_src

** Dired mode and visiting files

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/][my home folder]]

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/dm/cfd/app/PSE2/benchmark.v2/0410f736-9499-43aa-b974-baa1f0151621/ac_inputs.json][json file]]

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/pse2_venv_prod.yml][yml file]]

** Terminal emulator

There are quite some alternatives to get shell functionality inside Emacs.

Here's a subset of those alternatives:

- [X] (ansi-term "/bin/bash")
- [X] (shell-command) and (async-shell-command)

* Python
:PROPERTIES:
:results: replace
:exports:  code
:END:

** Basic example

Programmers only write two programs:
- Hello World
- Factorial

#+begin_src python :results output
  print('Hello World')
#+end_src

** Plottting
:PROPERTIES:
:exports: code
:tangle: /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/example.py
:END:

#+begin_src python :results file
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
  path = './demo.png'
  plt.savefig(path)
  return path
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/ :results raw
  module load anaconda/2-5.1.0
  python example.py
#+end_src

** EIN (Emacs IPython Notebook)

(async-shell-command "jupyter notebook --no-browser")

* Magit

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

It can actually be faster than using the command line!

#+begin_comment
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you are
finished talking, type RET twice.

Well, people don't get Emacs... They say it's complicated

Emacs?  Hah!  I would appreciate it if you would continue.

I simply love Emacs...

Are you sure?

Oh yes!

* PDF

* Cross platform

=Emacs runs on several operating systems regardless of the machine type. The
main ones are: GNU, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, MS Windows and
Solaris.=

=We include support for some proprietary systems in GNU Emacs in the hope that
running Emacs on them will give users a taste of freedom and thus lead them to
free themselves.=

Quoted from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux][here]].

** Android

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

Quite useful since Emacs is my agenda.

(switch-to-buffer "*Org Agenda*")

* Conclusion

GNU Emacs allows you to define the way you do your computing.

The users control the software.

Its devoted community is what makes it special.

* Getting help

Feel free to approach me anytime.
I will tailor my help to your needs.

Keep in mind that GNU Emacs is also the self documenting text editor!

- there are lots of recourses out there. I happen to know them quite well.
- I'd be happy to advice any of you by understading your needs and tailor the
solution given those needs.

** Vi(m) users

=Recall that vi vi vi is the editor of the beast.=
(joke by Richard Stallman.)

If you're used to vi(m) keybindings:
- try EVIL mode;
- use Spacemacs.

* You've witnessed...

...a very small fraction of all the capabilities.

** But...

...you've also witnessed the best thing ever without noticing.

This will be best understood by Emacs users.

This presentation was done using org mode and its literate programming
capabilities.

Org mode is life changing, seriously. But I shall not elaborate on that.

=Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead
of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.=
