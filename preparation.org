* Hello!

[[file:images/logo.png]]

Welcome to my customized instance of GNU Emacs.

#+begin_comment
- hi
- my setup (VM, Ubuntu)
- difficult talk given that we don't share a common background (even amongst
  emacs user)
- you will have tons of questions, but please try to abstract from the
technicalities of what you'll be seeing
- this is not a tutorial, please do not focus on the how, but on the WHAT!
- Google translator?

* What is GNU Emacs?

The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html][website]] says:

(insert a good excuse for this blank space)

#+begin_comment
- open website with eww
- paste An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more.
- Let's assume you have downloaded it and let's run it!
#+end_comment

** Let's run it!

=Welcome to GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system.=

The plots thickens... What is GNU?

** GNU/Linux?

- the above picture sums up everything I will be tetting for the next 5 minutes
- who can antecipate what I'm going to talk about?
- who are these people? anyone?
- we need a short historical context

*** Richard Stallman

[[file:images/stallman.jpeg]]

- Launched the GNU Project (GNU's not Unix) in 1983 with the goal of:

  - creating a complete Unix-compatible software system composed entirely of
    free software.

- developed GNU Emacs in 1985;

- founded the Free Software Foundation.

**** Free Software

Free software - free as in freedom, not as in free beer.

It gives software users the freedom to use, study, distribute and modify it.

*** Linus Torvalds

[[file:images/linus.jpeg]]

- developed a kernel (Linux) for the GNU operating system in 1994;

- created git in 2005.

Open source - a software development model that encourages open collaboration.

It provides better code and faster deployment.

*** Conclusion

- It's either GNU+Linux or GNU/Linux, not just +Linux+.

- GNU Emacs is part of this amazing operating system.

- You can do pretty much everything without leaving it.

* Why a text editor?

One programm to rule them all.

Free our brain from trivial text manipulation.

** Example

Given the following text, let's do smth stuff:

aadcg@vestas.com
amaol@vestas.com
asoad@vestas.com
calvr@vestas.com
darfe@vestas.com
erofi@vestas.com
gofmi@vestas.com
miabd@vestas.com
rebrf@vestas.com
rijmc@vestas.com
timdc@vestas.com

Oh man...

=TRAMP is for transparently accessing remote files from within Emacs.=

TRAMP stands for Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple Protocol.

** Going wherever without ever leaving

*** Example 1

#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/ :results raw
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm!'
  uptime
  nproc
  who
#+end_src

#+begin_comment
- :results raw
- C-c C-c
- rectangle
- drop duplicates
- upper case
- add e-mail
- comma macro
#+end_comment

*** Exampke 2

#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net|ssh:aadco@ac003:~/
  echo 'Hello Mindstorm! Got some processors?'
  who
  nproc
#+end_src

** Dired mode and visiting files

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/][my home folder]]

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/dm/cfd/app/PSE2/benchmark.v2/0410f736-9499-43aa-b974-baa1f0151621/ac_inputs.json][json file]]

- [[/ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:/ifs/home/aadco/pse2_venv_prod.yml][yml file]]

** Terminal emulator

There are quite some alternatives to get shell functionality inside Emacs.

Here's a subset of those alternatives:

- [ ] ansi-term (or term)
- [X] shell-command and async-shell-command


- [ ] I need to do this
- [ ] and also that
- [X] and that

* Python
:PROPERTIES:
:results: replace
:exports: code
:END:

** Basic example

Programmers only write two programs:
- Hello World
- Factorial

#+begin_src python :results output
  print('Hello World')
#+end_src

** Plottting
:PROPERTIES:
:exports: code
:END:

#+begin_src python :results file :tangle /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/example.py
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  x = [i for i in range(50)]
  y = [i for i in range(50)]

  plt.plot(x, y, 'o')
  path = './demo.png'
  plt.savefig(path)
  return path
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./demo.png]]

#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:aadco@login.mindstorm.vestas.net:~/ :results raw
  module load anaconda/2-5.1.0
  python example.py
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

=Magit is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an
Emacs package.= (from [[https://magit.vc/][here]])

It can actually be faster than using the command line!

Well, people don't get Emacs...

#+begin_comment
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you are
finished talking, type RET twice.

Well, people don't get Emacs... They say it's complicated

Emacs?  Hah!  I would appreciate it if you would continue.

I simply love Emacs...

Are you sure?

Oh yes!

** Cross platform

=Emacs runs on several operating systems regardless of the machine type. The
main ones are: GNU, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, MS Windows and
Solaris.=

=We include support for some proprietary systems in GNU Emacs in the hope that
running Emacs on them will give users a taste of freedom and thus lead them to
free themselves.=

Quoted from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#gnu-linux][here]].

*** Android

Not surprisingly, I run Emacs on my Android phone.

** Conclusion

GNU Emacs allows you to define the way you do your computing.

The users control the software.

* Getting help

I am here.

GNU Emacs is also the self documenting text editor!

It all comes down to C-h something

#+begin_comment
There's more than enough recourses out there. I happen to know them quite
well. I'd be happy to advice any of you by understading your needs and tailor
the solution given those needs.

If you're too used to vi(m) keybindings:
- use EVIL mode
- use Spacemacs
